# RD2L Rules

### 1. Communication and Conduct Rules

1. All official admin communication will be done through the Discord server.
2. Participants may not engage in:  
	1. Hate speech (attacks based on a person’s race, religion, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, etc); 
	2. Cyber-bullying;
	3. Doxxing;
  	4. If you see any of the aforementioned behaviours, you can report it to Community Moderators or Admins by messaging them on Discord, using the Complaint Form in the Discord #welcome Channel, or by messaging RD2LBot on Discord.  
3. These conduct rules apply to both official games and Discord.
4. Should an issue not covered by these rules arise, the situation will be handled at the admins' discretion.

### 2. Season Rules

1. The RD2L season is divided into a group stage and single elimination playoffs. The duration of the group stage and the format of the playoffs will be announced on Discord by the admin team at the start of the season.
2. RD2L teams play one series every week. The series are BO2 in the group stage and BO3 in the playoffs.
3. Standings are determined by the win-lose ratio of the teams. If multiple teams are tied in the standings going into playoffs, the tie is broken as follows:  
	1. Head to Head - the record of tied teams against each other is compared; if there is a clear winner, they go through. The same applies if there’s a clear loser. If there is not a clear winner/loser,  
	2. Strength of schedule - tied teams are assigned a score, which is calculated by summing up the total number of wins of each opponent played against during the season. Each opponent’s wins, as well as the final score, are adjusted for the amount of games the teams played in total. The higher score wins the tie.  
	3. If there is still a tie, it is preferred that the tied teams play a BO1 tiebreaker to determine the winner before next week’s official series.  
4. The number of teams per division will depend on the number of captains and players signed up, with a minimum of 6 teams.
5. Each division will have its own admins. These admins will be the first point of contact for captains and players in the division. They will also be responsible for helping run the draft, calling forfeits, approving stand-ins, assigning free agents, checking results and handling any other disputes which may arise.
6. In a case of uneven number of teams, the top ranked team who previously did not have a bye will get a bye (0-0 score) for that week.

### 3. Registration Rules

1. Only individual sign-ups are accepted.
2. All sign-ups are reviewed by a division admin and may be vouched or denied at the division admins’ discretion.
3. Participants may sign up as players or captains. Division admins may impose requirements for participants signing up as captains, such as a rank floor requirement or requiring them to have played in previous RD2L seasons.
4. Participants may play in both divisions.
5. Participants must sign up with their main account.
	1. Participants must publicly display their match data for the duration of the season. Private match data on sign-up will result in the removal of the participant’s sign up. Hiding match data during the season will result in a punishment at the discretion of the division admins.
	2. This account may not be used by any other player. 
	3. Participants must alert the admins if the rank on this account does not accurately reflect their skill level, in which case the admins may adjust this rank for league balancing purposes. 
	4. Participants must alert the admins to any alternate accounts they own, especially if they actively use them. Failure to do so may lead to removal from the league.  
	5. All RD2L games must be played on the Steam account the participant used to sign up. If the main account can not be accessed, an alternative account may be used. This has to be communicated towards both the admins and the opposing captain.  
6. Participants must have a minimum of 500 games played on the account they sign up with, with a minimum of 250 wins.   
	1. The sign-ups of participants who have fulfilled this requirement across multiple accounts, but not on a single one, will be reviewed and accepted or denied at the discretion of the division admins.
7. Participants should not register if they expect to miss more than 2 weeks in the season (including playoffs).
8. Participants have the option of registering as free agents, and may be assigned to teams missing players throughout the season, either as permanent free agents or temporary standins.
9. Any participants found breaking these rule will be punished at the discretion of the admins on a case by case basis.

### 4. Draft Rules

1. The player pool of the draft is made up of a number of players equal to the number of captains times four. If the number of signed up players exceeds the required amount of captains, the pool of draftable players will be decided on a first come first serve basis.
2. Captains take turns picking 1 player at a time from the available player pool.
3. Each captain drafts 4 players for a total of 5 players on the team.
4. The pick order for the first round will be based on the captains’ ranks.
	1. The format of the player draft is the EU Draft system, meaning that the pick order for each round is determined by the average MMR of the team after the conclusion of the previous round.

### 5. Team Rules

1. If a team loses a player, they have to ask for a free agent in accordance with the Free Agent Rules.
2. Captains are responsible for drafting the players and organising their RD2L team.  
	1. Captains are the primary contact for their team, for communication with both the admin team and other team captains.  
	2. The organization of the team may be delegated to a team member if the team member and captain wish to do so.  
3. Each team must use an in-game team that is new and unique to that season, meaning that it has not been used in previous seasons, for teams in other divisions during the current season, or outside of RD2L. 
4. Captains must ticket all games and series played.  
	1. Teams must use the same unique in-game team for every game player.
	2. The Home team captain is responsible for ticketing the lobby. The home team in the Group Stage is the team listed on the left hand side of the matchup, whereas in playoffs the home team is the upper team in the matchup.
	3. If a game is found to have been improperly ticketed by the home team, the result of the game must be submitted with screenshots of the result to the division admin within 24 hours of the game, and the following punishments apply to the first game following the offence:
		1. First offence: Level 2 Draft Penalty (-70 seconds)
		2. Second offence: Level 3 Draft Penalty (-110 seconds)
		3. Third offence: Additional loss on team’s standings score (in groups), Forfeit of Game 1 (in playoffs series)
5. Players are expected to stay with their RD2L team until the season is over. Players that leave their teams before the season is over may be punished at the division admins' discretion.
6. Captains can ask admins to remove certain players exhibiting disruptive behaviour (e.g. griefing, inactivity). The admin team will then make a decision based on information from both parties (the player and the captain).

### 6. Game Rules

1. All series are to be played in Captains Mode lobbies on Luxemburg, hosted and ticketed by the home team captain.
2. Teams will do a coin flip for side/pick choice in the first game of a series. The loser of the game 1 coin flip has side/pick choice in game 2. In case of a game 3, the teams will do another coin flip.

8. Each team is allowed up to 15 minutes of pause time per game, unless both teams agree to more.  
	1. If a player does not reconnect, a team may continue playing without them. Controlling their hero is allowed.  
	2. Pause time used to contact an admin in order to get a ruling does not count toward either total.  
	3. Pauses in the hero selection phase are only allowed if one of the drafters disconnects. Strategic disconnects to gain more draft time will be punished.  
9. Teams have up to 15 minutes after a game to start the next game in the series.  
	1. Teams can reschedule matches to an earlier date. The division admins must be notified, and the penalty rules (6.5) apply to the scheduled day and time.

### 7. Stand-in Rules

1. A team missing one of their players is eligible to use a stand-in for that player.  
	1. The stand-in must currently have their MMR be equal or lower than the sign-up MMR of the player they are replacing.
		1.  In the case that the missing player has an MMR of 3000 or lower, the stand-in used for the missing player can be up to 1000 MMR higher, with a maximum of 3000 MMR. For example, if you are missing a 1400 MMR player, you can find a stand-in with up to 2400 MMR, but if you are missing a 2300 MMR player, the maximum MMR of your stand-in is 3000 MMR.
	2. The stand-in must have played at least 1 season of RD2L or any tournaments held on the RD2L platform (such as RD2L mini).   
	3. The opposing captain must be notified about the stand-in. To do so, ping the opposing captain in the #wed-captains or #sun-captains Discord channels with the names and Dotabuff links of both the missing player and the proposed standin.  
	4. The opposing captain must approve of the stand-in before they can be used in the game. If the opposing captain feels that the proposed stand-in is unfair, the captain may contact the division admins by pinging them in the #wed-captains or #sun-captains Discord channels. In this case, the admins have the final say on whether the stand-in is allowed or not.  
	5. If no other player is available, a stand-in with a higher MMR can be used if the other captain agrees.  
2. Teams may use up to two stand-ins per game
	1. The use of a stand-in caused by not yet having received a free agent does not count toward the above total.  
3. The use of an unauthorized stand-in may be punished by a retroactive forfeit for the offending team.  

### 8. Free Agent Rules

1. If a captain wishes to replace an inactive or disruptive player, they may ask for a free agent using the Free Agent Request Form.  
	1. Captains must be able to prove that the player being replaced is inactive or disruptive.  
2. If a captain has submitted a request for a free agent, the admins will present the council with a selection of eligible free agents (within +200 and -1000 mmr of the missing player). The council then votes on which of the proposed free agents should be removed from the list of options, which is then given to the captain. The captain then chooses their free agent from the list presented to them.
	1. The same free agents may be offered to multiple captains, with the first captain to respond with a decision being the one awarded the free agent.
