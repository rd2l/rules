# RD2L Rules 

### Communication and general player conduct

1. All official admin communication will be done through the Discord server.
2. Participants may not engage in:  
	1. Hate speech (attacks based on a person’s race, religion, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, etc); 
	2. Cyber-bullying;
	3. Doxxing;
  	4. If you see any of the aforementioned behaviours, you can report it to Community Moderators or Admins by messaging them on Discord, using the Complaint Form in the Discord #welcome Channel, or by messaging RD2LBot on Discord.  
3. These conduct rules apply to both official games and Discord.
4. Should an issue not covered by these rules arise, the situation will be handled at the admins' discretion.

### Registration Rules



1. Only individual sign-ups are accepted.
2. All sign-ups are reviewed by an admin and may be accepted or denied at the admins’ discretion.
3. Participants must sign up with their main account.
    1. Participants must publicly display their match data for the duration of the season. Private match data on sign-up can result in the removal of the participant's sign-up. Hiding match data during the season can result in a punishment at the discretion of the admin team.
        1. Players may choose to hide their match data in between RD2L matches, but are required to parse their match data within 24 hours of their RD2L matches.
    2. The account may not be used by any other player.
    3. Participants must alert the admin team if the rank on this account does not accurately reflect their skill level, in which case the admins may adjust this rank for the purpose of balancing the league.
    4. All RD2L games must be played on the Steam account the participant used to sign up. If the main account can not be accessed, an alternative account may be used. This has to be communicated towards both the admins and the opposing captain beforehand.
4. Participants should not register if they expect to miss more than 3 weeks in the season, including playoffs.
5. Participants have the option of registering as free agents and as such may be assigned to teams missing players throughout the season.
6. Any participants found breaking these rules will be punished at the discretion of the admin team on a case by case basis.

### Team & Player Rules



1. Captains are responsible for drafting the players as well as organizing their RD2L team for the duration of the season.
    1. Captains are responsible for communicating with both the admin team and other team captains.
    2. The organization of the team may be delegated to a team member if both the team member and captain wish to do so.
2. Captains must create a new and unique in-game team for each season of RD2L, meaning that it has not been used in previous seasons, for teams in other divisions during the current season, or outside of RD2L.
3. Players are expected to stay with their RD2L team for the duration of the season. Players that leave their teams before the season is over may be punished with a standard ban for the duration of 3 RD2L seasons.
4. Players are expected to play to the best of their ability at all times.
    3. Captains can ask admins to remove players that are exhibiting disruptive behaviour (e.g. griefing, inactivity). The admin team reserves the right to act on information provided by both parties.
5. Players are required to use their official name in in-game lobbies throughout the playoffs.
    4. Additionally, players are prohibited from using offensive Steam names while they are participating in RD2L. The admin team reserves the right to penalize and punish players on a case by case basis.

### Stand-in Rules



1. A team missing one of their players is eligible to use a stand-in for that player.
    1. The stand-in must currently have their MMR be equal or lower than the sign-up MMR of the player they are replacing.
    2. In seasons that use a single unified pool of players and aren’t separated by smaller divisions, the following rule may apply:
        1. If the missing player has an MMR of 3000 or lower, the stand-in used for the missing player can be up to 1000 MMR higher, with a maximum of 3000 MMR. This means that for example a missing 1400 MMR player can be replaced by a stand-in with up to 2400 MMR, while a missing 2300 MMR player can be replaced by a stand-in with up to 3000 MMR.
    3. The stand-in must have played at least one season of RD2L or any tournaments held on the RD2L platform, such as Mini.
    4. The opposing captain must be notified about the stand-in. To do so, mention the opposing captain in the corresponding captains channels in the RD2L Discord server and provide the names and Dotabuff links for both the missing player and the proposed stand-in.
    5. The opposing captain must approve of the stand-in before they can be used in the game. If the opposing captain feels that the proposed stand-in is unfair, the captain proposing the standin may contact the division admins by pinging them in the respective channels. In this case, the admins have the final say on whether the stand-in is allowed or not.
    6. If no player is available, a stand-in with a higher MMR can be used if the opposing captain agrees.
2. Teams may use up to two stand-ins per game.
3. The use of an unauthorized stand-in may be punished by a retroactive forfeit for the offending team.

### Free Agent Rules



1. If a team wishes to replace an inactive or disruptive player, they may ask for a free agent using the Free Agent Request Form.
    1. Captains must be able to prove that the player being replaced is inactive or disruptive to the team environment.
2. If a captain has submitted a request for a free agent, the admins will present the council with a selection of eligible free agents. The council then votes on which of the proposed free agents should be removed from the list of options, which is then given to the captain in question. The captain then chooses their free agent from the list presented to them.
    2. The same free agents may be offered to multiple captains, with the first captain to respond with a decision being the one awarded the free agent.

### Streaming Rules



1. Caster all chat is strictly prohibited.
2. Players are allowed to stream their RD2L games, as long as the delay on the stream is equal or higher than the in-game spectator delay.
3. Community members are allowed to cast RD2L games on their personal streams, as long as the delay on the stream is equal or higher than the in-game spectator delay.
    1. Certain matches including the seasonal Grand Finals may be assigned to a predetermined set of casters. These will be the only casters allowed in the lobby and different delay requirements may apply for community streams of games with assigned casters.
4. Stream sniping is not allowed.

### Game Rules



1. All games are to be played in Captains Mode lobbies on the Luxembourg servers, hosted and ticketed by the home team captain.
    1. The home team is the team listed on the left hand side of the provided list of group stage matchups or the upper team in the playoff bracket.
    2. If a game is found to have been improperly ticketed by the home team, the result of the game must be saved as a screenshot and submitted to the respective division admin within 24 hours of the game ending. Additionally, the following punishments apply to the first game following the offence:
        1. First offence: Level 2 Draft Penalty (-70 seconds)
        2. Second offence: Level 3 Draft Penalty (-110 seconds)
        3. Third offence: Additional loss on a team’s standing score during group stages, or a forfeit of game 1 during playoffs.
2. The lobby must have a minimum of 2 minutes of spectator delay.
3. Teams will flip a coin to determine the choice of side or pick order for the first game of a series. The loser of that coin flip is the first to choose in the second game. In case of a game 3, the teams will do another coin flip to determine which team gets to pick between side and pick order.
4. The start time for the series is 20:00 CET for both divisions. It is suggested that players begin gathering in the lobby 15 minutes before the official start time in case a stand-in might be required.
    1. The standard start time for the series changes in accordance with daylight saving time.
5. Captains must enforce penalties if their opponents are late. The penalties are enforced for all games in the series and are as follows:
    1. 10 minutes past start time - Level 1 Draft Penalty
    2. 15 minutes past start time - Level 2 Draft Penalty
    3. 20 minutes past start time - Level 3 Draft Penalty
    4. 25 minutes past start time - Game 1 forfeit
    5. 30 minutes past start time - Series forfeit
6. If 20 minutes have passed and neither team is ready to play, a double forfeit is issued.
7. In order to claim a forfeit win or a penalty due to the other team not being ready in time, the captain must do the following:
    1. Take a screenshot of the ticketed lobby with all 5 players from the team’s official roster (or a lineup consisting of at least 3 players from the roster and at most 2 authorized stand-ins) seated in the Radiant or Dire slots, ready to play, with the team name visible;
    2. Post the screenshot in the division’s captains channel on Discord, using mentions to notify a division admin and the opposing captain, stating that you are claiming a forfeit win or enforcing a draft penalty.
8. Each team is allowed up to 15 minutes of pause time per game, unless both teams agree to a higher amount.
    1. If a player does not reconnect in time, a team may continue playing without them. Controlling the missing players’ hero is allowed.
    2. Pause time used to contact an admin in order to get a ruling does not count toward either teams’ total.
    3. Pauses in the hero selection phase are only allowed if one of the drafters disconnects. Strategic disconnects to gain more draft time will be punished at the discretion of the admin team.
9. Teams have up to 15 minutes after a game to start the next game in the series.
    1. Teams can reschedule games to an earlier date. The division admin must be notified, and the penalty rules listed under point 5 apply to the rescheduled date and time.
    2. If the teams wish to delay a game to a later date, approval of the division admins is required.
10. Malicious or fake GG calls will be punished.
11. Games may be remade if:
    1. There is a major issue affecting gameplay and both team captains agree to a remake;
    2. A player accidentally selects a wrong hero.
    3. This remake must be requested earlier than 1 minute before the first bounty rune spawns.
    4. The remake must be hosted in either All Pick or Captain’s Mode with the same hero picks for both teams.
12. Scripts and macros are strictly prohibited in official RD2L games. Players that are found using either in official games may be punished at the discretion of the admin team.
    1. Possible punishments include retroactive forfeits on the matches in question and a ban from the league.
13. If a game breaking bug is found, the admin team reserves the right to ban the abuse of said bug. Players discovering game breaking bugs must inform the admin team. Abusing a game breaking bug may lead to a forfeit or remake of the game in question, based on the decision made by the admin team.
14. All chat is allowed, unless either team requests no all chat.
    1. Tipping, using the chat wheel or hero taunts are all allowed in official matches.
    2. All chat is always allowed for the purpose of calling GG.
    3. All chat during games will be civil and in accordance with the general RD2L rules.
    4. Continuous use of all chat for anything other than important game information (pauses, surrenders, etc.) after a “no all chat” request by either team may result in punishment at the division admin’s discretion.
